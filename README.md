remarks about sum-even

;for adding even numbers out of the array i used simple loop to iterate through th whole array
;for checking positive sign i performed test with 1.
;then i use jumpifzero to jump this way i performed sum and count.


remarks about sum-odd

;for adding odd numbers out of the array i used simple loop to iterate through th whole array
;for checking positive sign i performed test with 1.
;then i use jumpifnotzero to jump this way i performed sum and count.

remarks about sum-pos

;for adding odd numbers out of the array i used simple loop to iterate through th whole array
;for checking positive sign i performed test with 8000h.
;then i use jumpifzero to jump this way i performed sum and count.


Overall remarks

; this was a pretty easy task trigering our basic understading of test and conditional jump operations.
